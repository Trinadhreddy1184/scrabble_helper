# What is Scrabble Helper?
**Scrabble Helper** is a simple shell program that displays a list of possible Scrabble words, given a set of letters.

As a (relatively) seasoned OOP programmer, my goal with this project was to practice Elixir and functional programming: 
  - First, by building a [Ruby](https://github.com/ruby/ruby) implementation (easy peasy);
  - Then, by converting that implementation to [Elixir](https://github.com/elixir-lang/elixir) (not so easy peasy).

This ended up a _fantastic_ introduction to the terrifying-yet-wonderful world of functional programming, and I can't wait to dive into some actual Phoenix applications. (Please wish me luck. _Please_.)

## Installation
**Scrabble Helper** requires a local installation of either [Ruby](https://github.com/ruby/ruby) or [Elixir](https://github.com/elixir-lang/elixir) (or both).
  - [Click here for Ruby installation instructions](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/documentation/installation/)
  - [Click here for Elixir installation instructions](https://elixir-lang.org/install.html)

After installing one or both of the above, follow these directions:
  1. Clone down this Scrabble Helper repository to your local machine, using the green Code button.
  2. Open a terminal session, and navigate to the Scrabble Helper repository.
  3. Within your terminal session, enter `chmod +x run_scrabble.sh` to enable permissions.
  4. Finally, within your terminal session, enter `./run_scrabble.sh` to run the program.

## Features and Usage

To use **Scrabble Helper**, select either the Ruby or Elixir implementation (which produce identical results), then enter a series of letters. The tool will check your input against the latest [Scrabble dictionary](https://github.com/redbo/scrabble/blob/master/dictionary.txt) to produce a list of possible words.

For example, an input of `band` will produce `AB, AD, AN, AND, BA, BAD, BAND, DAB, DAN, NA, NAB`. Note that each letter in the input can only be used once, just like in Scrabble.

## Uninstallation

Just delete the repository from your local machine, and you're done! Simple and clean (like the way that you're making me feel tonight~ðŸŽµ)
